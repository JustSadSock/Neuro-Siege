# Development Plan

This document outlines the recommended steps for building **Neuro-Siege**. The project will be divided into several core modules and supporting files.

## Initial File Structure
```
Neuro-Siege/
├─ index.html
├─ main.js
├─ map.js
├─ ai.js
├─ ui.js
└─ assets/
   ├─ images/
   └─ sounds/
```

## Modules
### `index.html`
- Sets up the base HTML page.
- References the required JavaScript files.
- Loads CSS for styling.

### `main.js`
- Initializes game variables and states.
- Contains the primary `gameLoop()` function which updates game logic and renders frames.
- Handles player input and orchestrates interactions with other modules.

### `map.js`
- Manages map generation and rules.
- Provides functions to load, update, and render the map tiles.

### `ai.js`
- Implements enemy and ally artificial intelligence behaviors.
- Contains pathfinding, decision making, and interaction with the map and player.

### `ui.js`
- Controls on-screen elements such as menus, HUD, and notifications.
- Manages event listeners for user interactions.

## Loading Assets
- Place images and sounds under the `assets/` directory.
- Use asynchronous loading to fetch assets before starting the main game loop.
- Consider using a preloader screen while assets are being fetched.

## Core Functions
- `gameLoop()` – main loop called with `requestAnimationFrame`.
- `loadAssets()` – preloads images and sounds.
- `initGame()` – sets up initial game state and starts the loop once assets are ready.

Follow this plan as a baseline to expand the game's features and content.
